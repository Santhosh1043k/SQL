stored procedures - is a prepared sql code that you can save great if there's  a query that you write often

                      delimiter $$                  we should first setup the delimiter to the set of queries
                      create procedure find_customer()  
                      begin
                      	select * 
                          from customers;
                      end $$                          end the delimiter here
                      delimiter ;
                      
                      call find_customer();           to call the stored procedure
                      
                      drop procedure find_customer;    to delete procedure



                       delimiter $$
                      create procedure find_customer(in id int)  creating the stored procedure for a stored parameter
                      begin
                      	select * 
                          from customers
                          where customer_id = id;
                      end $$
                      delimiter ;
                      call find_customer(1);              to call the id we specify the id inside the parameter

triggers - when an event happens,do something
            ex.(insert,update,delete)
            check data,handles errorss,auting tables

            
            create trigger pay_scale_before_update   to create the triggers
            before update on employees                use update before or after
            for each row                              in each row
            set new.salary = (new.pay_scale * 2000);    set salary and pay_scale to new because sql wants to understand the new update

          and after updating the pay_scale leads to a new salary amount using triggers

            create trigger pay_scale_before_insert
            before insert on employees              use insert for inserting the new row
            for each row
            set new.salary = (new.pay_scale * 2000);
          and after inserting the new row our trigger will update the value automatically
