intalling.... my sql on my local machine
get done with all my necessary requirements

for creating database CREATE DATABASE myDB; myDB is my database name
for deleting db DROP DATABASE myDB;
for changing my db as read only mode: ALTER DATABASE READ ONLY = 1;
vice versa for read only mode: ALTER DATABASE READ ONLY = 0;
for using db as the system schema: USE myDb;

to create a new table :create table employees(    in this line we should name the table
                       emp_id int,                in the we should note the column name aswell as column datatype 
                       f_name varchar(50),
                       l_name varchar(50),
                       pay_scale decimal(5,3),
                       h_date date
                       );                          close;

rename the column name:alter table employees      in this we should use the alter keyword
                        rename column f_name to first_name;  rename keyword

adding another extra column the table : alter table employees

modyfying the length of the column:alter table employees
                                  modify column first_name varchar(100); at first it is in 50 value we had changed this to 100

deleting the column:alter table employees
                    drop column h_date;  we just delete the H_date column in the employee table

changing the position of the column:alter table employees
                                    modify address varchar(50) to change the position the specific column we should call the the column
                                    after l_name; we should note the position that after the which column (after  query is must)
postioning in the first column:alter table employees
                                modify address varchar(50)
                                first; postioning first by using first keyword
adding values to the rows : 
                            insert into employees
                            values 		(1,"Santhosh","Kumar",50.90), comma implies the next values 
                            			(2,"Kumar","kokki",90.80);        we sholud type the date by datatype order
                            select * from employees;

adding specific values to rows:insert into employees(emp_id,first_name,l_name) we should implies the datatype at first
                                values 		
                                			(3,"Kumara","vel");

                                   from employees;

selecting the row by specific column value: select *        * means all
                                            from employees   from the table employees
                                           where emp_id =1;  by putting specific column value

using math fuction greater than equals to:select *
                                          from employees
                                         where pay_scale >=50;
